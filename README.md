Project Overview & Functionality 

1. Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
This project explores TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities, focusing on reshaping, transposing, and broadcasting. These operations are critical in deep learning for efficient data handling and transformation.
  
2. Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning 
This project evaluates the behavior of loss functions, particularly Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE). Understanding loss variations helps in optimizing model performance.

3. Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard
This project sets up a neural network using the MNIST dataset, logs training progress using TensorBoard, and enables visualization of accuracy and loss trends.

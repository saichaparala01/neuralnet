**1.Project Overview & Functionality**

1. Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
This project explores TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities, focusing on reshaping, transposing, and broadcasting. These operations are critical in deep learning for efficient data handling and transformation.
  
2. Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning 
This project evaluates the behavior of loss functions, particularly Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE). Understanding loss variations helps in optimizing model performance.

3. Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard
This project sets up a neural network using the MNIST dataset, logs training progress using TensorBoard, and enables visualization of accuracy and loss trends.


**2.Project Overview: Deep Learning & Image Processing Techniques**

This project focuses on three core areas in deep learning and image processing: convolution operations, feature extraction with filters and pooling, and data preprocessing techniques. Each section builds practical understanding through hands-on Python implementations.

1. Convolution Operations with Different Parameters 
Implement and analyze convolution operations using varying stride and padding values to observe their impact on feature extraction.


2. CNN Feature Extraction with Filters and Pooling  
Apply Sobel filters for edge detection and demonstrate max and average pooling operations.


3. Data Preprocessing: Standardization vs. Normalization
Compare normalization and standardization on a dataset and evaluate their impact on model performance.
